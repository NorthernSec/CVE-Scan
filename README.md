# CVE-Scan
Scan systems with NMap and parse the output to a list of CVE's, CWE's and DPE's

## Goals:
 * Scan a system with NMap or any other scanning tool and use the scan to analyse the systems for vulnerabilities
 * Have the posibility for multiple input formats (NMap scan, xml, Json, etc)
 * Use CVE-Search to enhance the scan to add more information
 * Have multiple export formats as well as webbrowser component
 
### Optional:
* Automatically download known scripts to use on exploits

## Installation:
Warning, this tutorial is for Linux systems (developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.10).
This program should run under Windows (and probably Mac) systems as well.

### Requirements
CVE-Scan uses the CVE-Search API to enhance your nmap scans. <br />
**Warning** CVE-Search is not included in CVE-Scan <br />
You can use [CIRCL](http://circl.lu)s [public API]
 (http://cve.circl.lu), or install CVE-Search localy, or on another accessible machine.
You can install [CVE-Search](https://github.com/PidgeyL/cve-search) from the git repo.
For now, CVE-Search does not have a "core" package yet (Without the webpages), but I will add this later on.
Once you installed CVE-Search, in the configuration file, make sure you set the correct URL to it.

CVE-Scan needs some aditional packages to work. Install them using:

```sudo apt-get install -y nmap``` (or your package manager of choice)

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Weasyprint has a set of sub-requirements. Please find the details [here](http://weasyprint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)

## Usage:
To use CVE-Scan, first run an nmap scan on a system. You can modify the
 parameters however you want, however, you'd want to include Service Detection
 and OS detection. Below, you can find a default nmap scan that will output to
 an xml file.

```nmap -A -O 192.168.0.1 -oX output.xml```

CVE-Scan is composed of 3 major functions:
 * **converter.py**  - Converts the nmap xml to the CVE-Scan json format
 * **analyzer.py**   - Analyses either an nmap xml or a CVE-Scan json and
 queries CVE-Search to obtain vulnerability information
 * **visualizer.py** - Visualizes the results of analyzer.py

and **Nmap2CVE-Search.py**, which does all of the above in 1 go.

You can either run ```python3 Nmap2CVE-Search.py output.xml``` to
 enhance and visualize the report, or
 ```python3 analyzer.py -x output.xml enhanced.json```, to create the
 enhanced report, followed by ```python3 visualizer.py enhanced.json```
 to visualize the report (default webserver on localhost:5050.
 Add -t for terminal view)
 
 All scripts in the `bin` folder can be called with the -h flag, to get more information about it.
